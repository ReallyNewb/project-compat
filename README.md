# project-compat
A collection of outdated Geode mods. These mods will not only be updated to have more support with modern Geode but to also bring support for JIT-less iOS.

> ℹ️ For your information, iOS 26+ broke StikDebug, leading the Geode app to crash every time it is launched with StikDebug.
> ⚠️ This project will not be updated until Geode v5.0.0 comes out.
